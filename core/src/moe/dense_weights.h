// The dense (non-expert) model weights, and the policy for keeping them resident.
//
// The streamer rebinds only the expert tensors; everything else in the gguf — header/metadata,
// embeddings, attention, norms, lm_head — is "dense", and how it is kept in RAM is a policy of its
// own (DenseWeightsMode): left mmap'd, mmap'd-and-warmed, or read once into anonymous buffers via
// O_DIRECT and rebound. This module owns that policy, the buffers it may allocate, and the residency
// sensor that reports how much of the dense set the kernel still has — the half the expert cache's
// own residency sensor is blind to.
//
// It reads through its OWN FileReader, so its O_DIRECT choice is independent of the expert stream's:
// the dense set may be pulled cache-bypassing while the experts are not, or the reverse. There is one
// definition of "which bytes are dense" here (byte_ranges), shared by the warm sweep, the anonymous
// read, and the sensor — the three used to compute it separately.
