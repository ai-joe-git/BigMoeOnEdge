// The eval-callback adapter: the only bridge between llama.cpp's compute graph and the
// expert streamer, and it uses only the public callback ABI (llama_context_params.cb_eval).
//
// Two phases share one callback:
//
//   Capture — during a one-token warm-up decode (experts still mmap-resident), every
//   graph node is offered to the callback in its "ask" pass. We scan each node's sources
//   for the recipe's expert weight tensors (named blk.<il>.<suffix>.weight) and record
//   the live ggml_tensor pointers per (layer, projection). No node is isolated. The
//   runtime then hands these to ExpertStreamSource::init, which rebinds them.
//
//   Stream — for real generation, we ask for only the routing nodes ffn_moe_topk-<il>.
//   ggml computes and synchronizes each alone, then calls back with the selected expert
//   ids materialized; we gather them respecting the view strides and call load_layer()
//   so the routed slices land before that layer's expert matmul runs.
