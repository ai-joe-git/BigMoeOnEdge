# BigMoeOnEdge — Android example

A minimal chat app that validates the throughput claim on a real phone: pick a pushed
`.gguf`, type a prompt, and watch the answer stream in while a live panel shows tok/s and
the per-token compute-vs-flash-I/O split and cache hit rate.

It runs the engine as the `bmoe-cli` binary (shipped as `libbmoe-cli.so`) via
`ProcessBuilder` from a foreground service — no JNI. This is the same pattern used by the
research harness and keeps the app a thin driver over the CLI.

## Build

1. Cross-compile and stage the engine binaries (needs the Android NDK):

   ```powershell
   pwsh ../../scripts/build-android.ps1
   ```

   This fills `app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/` with `libbmoe-cli.so` and the
   `libllama`/`libggml` shared libraries.

2. Build and install the APK. Open this folder in Android Studio, or from the command
   line generate the Gradle wrapper once (`gradle wrapper`) and then:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```

   The `gradle-wrapper.jar` is intentionally not committed; Android Studio and
   `gradle wrapper` both produce it.

## Push a model

```bash
adb push Qwen3-30B-A3B-Q4_K_M.gguf \
  /sdcard/Android/data/io.bigmoeonedge.example/files/
```

The model picker lists every `.gguf` in that directory.

## Expected numbers

On a phone with UFS 4.x storage and ~12 GB RAM, streaming Qwen3-30B-A3B-Q4_K_M with the
expert cache at 4000 MiB, 4 I/O lanes and 4 compute threads, decode settles around
**0.55–0.6 s/token (~1.8 tok/s)** — a model ~1.7× the device RAM, lossless. See
`../../docs/benchmark-method.md` for the full procedure and the cache/thread sweep.
