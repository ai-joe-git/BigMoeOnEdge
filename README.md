# BigMoeOnEdge

**Run Mixture-of-Experts models far bigger than your edge device's RAM.**

A Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model is made of many small "experts", and each generated token only
uses a few of them. BigMoeOnEdge takes that literally: it keeps the small always-needed parts of
the model at hand and reads just the experts each token asks for, directly from flash storage, at
the moment they're needed. The rest of the model stays on disk. That's what makes large open MoE
models (Qwen3, Gemma, gpt-oss and most of their relatives) runnable on edge devices whose RAM they
exceed several times over. The focus today is phones, where memory is tightest.

The flagship case: **gpt-oss-120b**, a ~60 GB model (Q4_K_M), on a phone with 12 GB of RAM. That's
about five times more model than memory, so holding it resident is simply impossible. It runs
anyway, at **1.3 tok/s** with the model's own settings (**2.2 tok/s** with one speed knob), against
**0.09 tok/s** for the same file loaded the ordinary way (mmap).

**And it's all plain CPU inference.** No GPU, no NPU, no special hardware: four CPU cores, the
phone's flash storage, and nothing else. The entire budget is a phone's UFS storage, a fraction of
the bandwidth a desktop NVMe drive offers, which is exactly why the expert cache, the dense-weight
policy and the read/compute overlap all have to earn their keep.

Streaming does not change what the model computes: the output is **byte-for-byte identical** to
running the model fully in RAM. Same weights, same math, just fetched later. There is exactly one
optional lossy setting, and it's always labelled as such.

Everything runs on **stock llama.cpp**. Upstream stays untouched, tracked as a plain submodule, and
the streaming works through its public API, so following new llama.cpp releases is a routine
submodule bump, not a merge.

Highlights:

- **gpt-oss-120b (Q4_K_M), ~5× device RAM**: **1.3 tok/s** at the model's own routing width against
  0.09 tok/s for the same file loaded the ordinary way (mmap), a **14×** difference at matched settings.
  **2.2 tok/s** with the one lossy knob on (less experts)
- **Lossless on models past RAM**: Qwen3-30B-A3B (Q4_K_M, 18.5 GB) up to **5.2 tok/s** and
  Gemma-4-26B-A4B (Q4_K_M, 17.0 GB) up to **4.1 tok/s** on the same phone, output identical to the
  resident model.
- **The problem only phones have**: several × past RAM, Android's reclaim keeps taking back the
  always-used weights mid-generation. `--dense-weights anon` puts them where reclaim can't cheaply
  take them, and it's worth **3.2×** on gpt-oss-120b on its own. A desktop or Apple-silicon streamer
  can lean on the OS page cache for tens of GB; a phone under memory pressure concedes almost none.
- **Easy to extend**: a new MoE architecture is one row in a registry, and nothing about a specific
  model is hardcoded in the streaming path. Because the engine sits *on* stock llama.cpp instead of
  replacing it, quantization formats, tokenizers and chat templates come for free: MXFP4 and Q4_K_M
  stream through the same code, since the per-expert stride is read from the model file at runtime.

> **About the numbers.** Measured on one device (OnePlus 15R: 12 GB RAM, 11.3 GB usable, UFS 4.x
> storage - **...imagine with UFS 5.x...**) over `adb shell`, 256-token greedy decode. Each number is the best observed for that
> configuration, and rows in a table can come from different benchmark sessions. Phone throughput
> moves a lot with device state (heat, free memory), so the same command can read lower. Full
> method and distributions: [docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md).

> Prior art, credited: this is an engineering package of ideas from AirLLM, Apple's *LLM in a

> [flash-moe](https://github.com/danveloper/flash-moe): a purpose-built Metal engine that streams a
> 397B MoE from SSD on Apple Silicon, and on an iPhone through a community fork. BigMoeOnEdge takes
> the other side of that problem: CPU-only, on Android, on stock llama.cpp, across architectures.

## Features

- **Expert streaming** (`--moe-stream`): reads only the experts each token routes to, straight
  from flash.
- **Expert cache** (`--cache-mb N|auto`): keeps the most-used experts in RAM, sized by hand or to
  the device; the biggest lever when the model's working set fits.
- **Direct flash reads** (`--io-threads N`): parallel read lanes that bypass the OS page cache.
- **Dense-weight policy** (`--dense-weights mmap|warm|anon`): how the always-used (non-expert)
  weights are held in memory. The decisive setting for models far past RAM: on gpt-oss-120b it's
  worth **3.2×** on its own.
- **I/O–compute overlap** (`--overlap`): hides flash latency behind compute. Byte-identical;
  needs a small optional add-on to llama.cpp (see [docs/seam.md](docs/seam.md)).
- **Turbo top-k** (`--n-expert-used N`): the one lossy knob. Fewer experts per token, ~+22–24%
  speed, output quality is yours to judge.
- **Multi-turn sessions and live telemetry**: the model stays loaded across chat turns, and every
  run can emit a per-token breakdown of where the time went.
- **Android demo app** ([`examples/android`](examples/android)): a chat app with a live telemetry
  panel and every knob above exposed in Settings.

## Supported models

| Architecture | Reference models | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `qwen3moe` | Qwen3-30B-A3B and siblings | Shipped default, validated below |
| `qwen2moe` | Qwen2 MoE family | Same layout as qwen3moe |
| `gemma4` | Gemma 4 MoE (e.g. 26B-A4B) | Fused expert layout, handled by its registry row |
| `gpt-oss` | OpenAI gpt-oss-20b / 120b | Purely routed; MXFP4 weights stream unchanged |

Adding an architecture is one row in the registry; expert counts and layouts are discovered from
the model file at runtime. Procedure: [docs/adding-a-model.md](docs/adding-a-model.md).
`bmoe-cli --list-archs` prints the compiled-in set.

## Benchmarks

All figures are measured, not modelled. Device and protocol are in the note above; all models are
Q4_K_M. **How to read the tables**: each row is one configuration of the same model on the same
phone.

- **Configuration**: the streaming settings used. *mmap baseline* is the same file loaded the
  ordinary way (no streaming), which is what the streamed rows are compared against. *k* is the
  number of experts used per token where it differs from the model's default.
- **tok/s**: generation speed; higher is better.
- **Flash/token**: data read from storage per generated token; lower means the cache is working.
- **Cache hit**: share of expert reads served from RAM instead of flash.

Bold marks the best configuration for that model.

### gpt-oss-120b (Q4_K_M) — ~60 GB on a 12 GB phone

| Configuration | tok/s | Flash/token | Cache hit |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **streamed, k=2, cache 2000 MiB, 8 lanes** | **2.2** | 590 MiB | 32% |
| streamed, k=2, no cache, 4 lanes | 1.8 | 909 MiB | — |
| streamed, default k=4, cache 2000 MiB, 8 lanes | 1.3 | 1292 MiB | 27% |
| streamed, default k=4, no cache, 4 lanes | 0.7 | 1817 MiB | — |
| mmap baseline (no streaming) | 0.09 | — | — |

All streamed rows use `--overlap --dense-weights anon --no-think`. The setting that unlocked this
model is `--dense-weights anon`: this far past RAM the phone keeps reclaiming the always-used
weights mid-generation, and moving them out of the page cache was worth **3.2×** by itself. Note
that `--no-think` disables the model's reasoning and costs quality at k=4; the full matrix and
quality notes are in [docs/benchmarks-gpt-oss.md](docs/benchmarks-gpt-oss.md).

### Qwen3-30B-A3B (Q4_K_M) — 18.5 GB

| Configuration | tok/s | Flash/token | Cache hit |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| mmap baseline (no streaming) | 2.0 (unstable) | — | — |
| streamed, no cache, 4 lanes | 1.7 | 1051 MiB | — |
| streamed, cache 2000 MiB, 4 lanes | 2.4 | 480 MiB | 53% |
| streamed, cache 4000 MiB, 4 lanes | 4.0 | 225 MiB | 76% |
| **streamed, auto cache (capped 4000 MiB), 4 lanes, overlap** | **5.2** | 225 MiB | 76% |

Cache size is the dominant lever here, and the auto-sized cache with a ceiling
([docs/adaptive-cache.md](docs/adaptive-cache.md)) is the winning recipe. The mmap baseline
averages ~2 tok/s but swings wildly token to token and evicts other apps.

### Gemma-4-26B-A4B (Q4_K_M) — 17.0 GB

| Configuration | tok/s | Flash/token | Cache hit |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| mmap baseline (no streaming) | 0.4 | — | — |
| streamed, no cache, 4 lanes | 1.6 | 904 MiB | — |
| streamed, cache 2000 MiB, 4 lanes | 2.2 | 366 MiB | 58% |
| streamed, cache 2000 MiB, 4 lanes, overlap | 2.8 | 365 MiB | 58% |
| **streamed, cache 4000 MiB, 4 lanes** | **4.1** | 144 MiB | 82% |

Gemma keeps more of itself permanently resident, so the 4000 MiB cache fits only when enough RAM is
free at launch; cache 2000 + overlap is the dependable everyday setting on this device.

### Turbo top-k — the one lossy option

Every model ships a routing width (how many experts each token uses; Qwen3 uses 8). Forcing it
lower cuts both compute and flash reads. A/B against the model's own width, same session,
back-to-back:

| Configuration | tok/s | Flash/token | Cache hit |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen3-30B, default (8 experts) | 4.0 | 225 MiB | 76% |
| **Qwen3-30B, 6 experts** | **5.0** (+24%) | 165 MiB | 77% |
| Gemma-4-26B, default | 4.1 | 144 MiB | 82% |
| **Gemma-4-26B, 6 experts** | **5.0** (+22%) | 98 MiB | 83% |

Everything else in this README changes *how* weights are fetched, never the math. This knob changes
*what* the model computes: output differs from the full model and quality can degrade. Judge it on
your own task before relying on it.

### What to expect in the app

The tables above are a benchmark protocol over `adb`, not a chat session. The demo app lands close:
the best gpt-oss config reads **1.9 tok/s** in the app against 2.2 over adb, about 13% below. The
gap is the protocol (short chat replies never fully warm the cache), not the app. The app's
telemetry panel reports the same fields as the CLI, so you can see it directly. Analysis:
[docs/warmup-analysis.md](docs/warmup-analysis.md).

### Desktop

The same trick works on desktop where a model exceeds RAM (quick check: Qwen3-30B on a 14.8 GiB
Windows PC streamed at 2.6 tok/s), but mobile is the target and desktop isn't tuned. If the model
fits in RAM, just run it resident.

## Quickstart (host)

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Helldez/BigMoeOnEdge.git
cd BigMoeOnEdge
scripts/build-host.sh

# stream a MoE model with a device-sized expert cache and 4 read lanes
build/cli/bmoe-cli -m Qwen3-30B-A3B-Q4_K_M.gguf --moe-stream \
  --cache-mb auto --cache-ceil-mb 4000 --io-threads 4 -t 4 -n 48 \
  --chatml -p "Explain MoE routing."
```

For a model several × device RAM, the shape that produced the gpt-oss numbers is:

```bash
build/cli/bmoe-cli -m gpt-oss-120b-Q4_K_M.gguf --moe-stream --overlap \
  --dense-weights anon --cache-mb 2000 --io-threads 8 -t 4 -n 256 \
  --chatml --no-think -p "Explain MoE routing."
```

The model must live on a real filesystem (on Android `/data/local/tmp/...`, not `/sdcard`). Omit
`--moe-stream` for the plain mmap baseline. The byte-identity gates (streamed == resident) run with
`cd build && ctest --output-on-failure` (needs `python3` with the `gguf` package).

## Quickstart (Android)

The demo app is in [`examples/android`](examples/android): build the CLI for arm64 with
`scripts/build-android.ps1`, build the APK, push a model. Settings expose every streaming knob with
a one-line note on what it does; defaults are the measured winning recipe for a model near RAM. For
a model several × RAM, switch the dense-weights policy to `anon` and give the cache a real budget.
A prebuilt debug APK is attached to each
[release](https://github.com/Helldez/BigMoeOnEdge/releases).

## How it works

The model loads file-backed, and the engine hooks llama.cpp's public evaluation callback. When a
layer picks its experts for the current token, the engine fetches exactly those slices from flash
just in time for the matmul, optionally caching the hottest ones and overlapping reads with
compute. No llama.cpp sources are modified. Design and the exact API contract:
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md), [docs/seam.md](docs/seam.md).

## Telemetry

Streaming a model past RAM fails in ways that all look the same from the outside: it's just slow.
The engine is instrumented so you can tell *which* slow you have.

`--progress` emits one line per token (`BMOE_PROGRESS {json}`) with wall time split into flash I/O,
cache management and compute, plus cache hit rate, bytes read, and the overlap stall. `--csv PATH`
writes the same per token, plus the memory picture the numbers have to be read against: resident
anonymous vs file-backed memory, what zram already took, what the device claims is available. The
Android app parses the same lines and renders them live while you chat.

The part worth stealing is that **the engine reports which of its own numbers are not measured**:

- **`compute_ms` is a residual, not a measurement.** No clock runs around llama.cpp's matmuls, so
  compute is whatever wall time is left after the measured terms come out. It silently absorbs page
  faults and scheduler stalls, which on a >RAM model is most of it.
- **So the residual gets decomposed.** `majflt` counts major faults inside `llama_decode`: non-zero
  means a dense weight re-faulted from flash, a residency stall wearing compute's clothes. `cpu_ms`
  against `wall_ms × threads` gives occupancy: near 100% is genuinely compute-bound, well below
  means throttled or preempted cores, not more math.
- **Unmeasured is a distinct value.** `0` where a platform can't report a counter, `-1` where a
  probe didn't run, `nan` for a routing weight the graph never exposed. Never a plausible-looking
  zero.

Two diagnostics go deeper when the per-token split isn't enough. `--route-trace` records which
experts every token routed to, per layer, with the weight and whether it was already resident;
`--compute-trace` times each individual graph node by returning `true` from the eval callback, so
compute stops being a residual and becomes measured. Both perturb the run that produces them and
both say so: a traced run is not a benchmark run.

Line protocol, CSV schema and the trace formats are versioned in
[docs/telemetry.md](docs/telemetry.md). CSV columns are additive, so read them by name.
