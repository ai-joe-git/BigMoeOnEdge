# Pressure-aware cache sizing

`--cache-dynamic` treats the cache budget as a ceiling rather than an instruction, and lets the
engine find the largest cache the device will actually concede. It is off by default.

## Why a budget cannot be a constant

The expert cache is the one lever that trades RAM for flash reads, so the temptation is to set it as
large as the device seems to allow. On a phone that is the wrong shape of decision, for three
reasons that are measured rather than argued:

**A budget the device refuses does not go unused — it starts a war.** Ask for more than the device
concedes and reclaim stops being an event and becomes a standing condition: pages are taken *during*
the decode, faulted back in, and taken again. On gpt-oss-120b the engine asking ~3.8 GiB on a device
that conceded ~3.0 ran a turn at 0.3 tok/s against 1.45 tok/s for the same turn without the fight.
The cache was not slightly too big; it was net negative.

**Restoring the stolen pages does not win it.** Bulk-restoring the whole cache after an idle reclaim
works mechanically — 2.0 GiB back in 6.4 s — and the kernel takes it back within 8 s. Throughput
does not move. The ask has to shrink; re-fetching what was taken is treating the scoreboard.

**The number is not knowable in advance.** It depends on the model (one token of gpt-oss at top-2
routes ~536 MiB, Qwen3-30B at top-8 routes ~1051 MiB), on the top-k, on the device, and on whatever
else the user has open right now. Any constant is wrong for some model on some phone on some day.

## Why the OS cannot be asked

The obvious design — subscribe to the platform's memory-pressure signal — does not survive contact
with Android:

| Signal | Why it fails |
| --- | --- |
| `/proc/meminfo` `MemAvailable` | Counts the page cache holding our *own* mmap'd dense weights as free, so it over-reports by roughly the model's resident size. This is what `--cache-mb auto` sizes from, and why it over-asks. |
| PSI (`/proc/pressure/memory`) | SELinux label `proc_pressure_mem`; no `untrusted_app` allow rule. Unreadable by an app. |
| `onTrimMemory` | Late, coarse, one-sided — it never signals that pressure *eased*, and the `RUNNING_*` levels are deprecated since API 34. |
| `mlock` / memcg `min`/`low` | `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` is 64 KiB on this device; cgroup v1 has no protection knobs an app can set. Nothing unprivileged protects anonymous memory. |

So the engine does not ask the OS anything. It watches what happens to memory it already holds.
A process may always ask about its **own** pages, on any device, with no permission and no vendor
cooperation — and pages we wrote, then lost, *are* reclaim, by definition.

## The loop

Three roles, one per concern, so the policy is portable and the syscalls are not:

- **Sense** (`core/src/io/platform_io.cpp`, `core/src/moe/expert_stream_source.cpp`)
  - `mincore()` over the cache's own anonymous buffers, walking the LRU cold end — the pages reclaim
    takes first. This is the primary signal: it is absolute (our pages are in RAM or they are not),
    needs no baseline, and sees the theft *before* those pages fault back and cost a read. Bounded
    and throttled; its cost lands in `mgmt_ms`, where a regression is visible rather than hidden.
  - `getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF).ru_majflt` deltas per token — the fast reflex between residency samples.
    Already measured for the telemetry, so it costs nothing new.
- **Decide** (`core/include/bmoe/cache_governor.h`) — AIMD with hysteresis. Pure policy: no
  syscalls, no clocks, no llama.cpp, no config reads. Unit-tested against a synthetic device
  (`tests/cache_governor_test.cpp`).
- **Act** (`ExpertStreamSource::set_cache_budget`) — resize and evict the cold tail. Driven once per
  token from the generation loop, which is the only point where no decode is in flight and an
  evicting shrink is safe.

The shape is TCP's, for the same reason TCP has it: an unobservable bottleneck, probed by watching
your own losses. Growth is additive because being wrong upward is cheap to give back; a cut is
multiplicative because the asymmetry is real — asking too much costs a continuous war mid-decode,
asking too little costs only a few points of hit rate.

```
every token, after the decode:
    if sampled residency < 0.90            → the kernel is taking the cache
    else if majflt > baseline*3 + 32       → reflex, once a calm baseline exists
        → ceiling := cap;  cap := max(cap * 0.7, floor);  wait out a cooldown

    else (calm):
        learn the baseline from this token
        after N calm tokens: cap += 64 MiB, up to min(user cap, ceiling * 0.9)
        after a long calm at the ceiling: forget it and re-test (the device may have changed)
```

## The floor is measured — and it is not the obvious one

The tempting floor is **one token's routed working set**. Below it, every token evicts what the next
one needs, so the cache holds nothing between tokens and its hit rate collapses. That is true, and
it is the bound `MoeStreamConfig::cache_min_mb` (1500 MiB) encodes as a static guess. It is still
the wrong floor, and the device said so.

Measured on gpt-oss-120b at top-4, `--cache-mb 2000 --cache-dynamic`:

| | |
|---|---|
| `token_demand_MiB` | 1815.4 |
| `cache_budget_MiB` | 1815.4 — the budget *is* the floor, to the decimal |
| `cache_cuts` | 1 — cut once, then pinned |
| `cache_hit_pct` | 8.2 — 1.8 GiB of RAM, for 8% of hits |
| `majflt/tok` | 5174, at 0.37 tok/s |

The loop cut 2000 → max(1400, 1815.4) = 1815.4 and stopped, because `cap > floor` was now false.
The sensor kept firing (`resident_frac` 1.000 → 0.937, 47k faults on one token) into a floor that
could not yield. A 9% cut, and the war went on.

The flaw is the comparison. "Below the floor the cache can only thrash" weighs the hits given up and
ignores that **the memory itself is the cost**: an unaffordable cache does not merely fail to earn
its hits, it starts a reclaim war worth several times any hit rate — and here it was buying 8%. The
falsifying evidence was already on the table: a hand-set 1000 MiB budget, far below that "floor",
runs this model well.

So usefulness yields to pressure. The only floor that may not yield is the **mechanical** one — the
widest layer of a pass, which the cache must be able to stage — and it is measured the same way
(`layer_demand_MiB`). `token_demand_MiB` stays in the telemetry, because where hits start is worth
knowing; it is simply not the same claim as where the cache must stop.

## Reading it

Per token (`--csv`, `BMOE_PROGRESS`): `resident_frac` — the sampled fraction of the cache still in
RAM, `-1` when unmeasured (throttled sample, streaming off, or a host that cannot report).

Per run (`# summary`, `BMOE_DONE`): `token_demand_MiB` (what one token demands), `layer_demand_MiB`
(the mechanical floor), `cache_budget_MiB` (where the loop settled), `cache_cuts` (how often the
device pushed back), `cache_resizes`.

A budget sitting exactly on `token_demand_MiB` with `cache_cuts` stuck at 1 is the failure above:
the loop wanted to cut and something floored it.

Reading `cache_budget_MiB` against `token_demand_MiB` is how a budget stops being a guess: a budget
near the demand holds about one token of routing history and its hits come from inter-token
correlation only; a budget far above it is either buying real reuse or buying a war, and
`cache_cuts` says which.

## `--dense-weights anon`: make the dense weights anonymous

The governor above manages the *cache*. The other half of the war is the *dense* (non-expert)
weights, whose policy is a single knob `--dense-weights mmap|warm|anon` (`DenseWeightsMode`, owned by
`core/src/moe/dense_weights.h`). `mmap` leaves them file-backed (the kernel reclaims them by dropping
the pages, and a later touch demand-faults them 4 KiB at a time — the slow-start baseline); `warm`
(the default) page-caches them once at load; `anon` reads each dense tensor once via O_DIRECT into an
aligned anonymous buffer and rebinds the tensor onto it. A reclaim of anonymous memory swaps to zram
rather than dropping to flash, so a refault is a fast zram decompress instead of a scattered flash
read. (`--dense-odirect` and `--no-warm-dense` remain as deprecated aliases for `anon` and `mmap`.)

The `anon` read reuses the expert-capture path: the router hook already records every weight leaf it
sees in the warm-up graph, and the runtime pairs the non-expert ones with their gguf offsets. It reads
through the dense module's own `FileReader`, so its O_DIRECT choice is independent of the expert
stream's — the experts can be streamed buffered while the dense set is pulled cache-bypassing, or the
reverse. It is a strict A/B lever, and the analysis says its upside is narrow — Q4 weights are close
to incompressible, so on a model whose dense set already fits resident, moving it flash→zram frees
nothing and is a wash. Where it can pay is a model actively losing its dense set to reclaim.

Two details keep the A/B honest rather than measuring load-time artefacts. First, the capture warm-up
decode faults the dense pages in *mmap-resident* before the read copies them into the anon buffers, so
for a moment the dense set is resident twice; once every tensor is rebound, the module drops those
now-unreferenced mmap pages with `MADV_DONTNEED` (`pio::vm_drop_file_pages`), so prefill starts from
the true anonymous-only footprint instead of a doubled peak the entry test would misread. Second, the
dense-residency sensor does not go blind: it samples the anon buffers directly (`mincore` reports
resident anon pages too), so `dense_resident_frac` keeps its meaning under the flag — whether zram is
holding the dense set — rather than reading unmeasured.

Byte-identity gates: `G6` proves the rebind changes not a single output byte against the mmap-resident
reference, and `G7` proves the same with O_DIRECT off (the read may bypass the page cache or not; the
rebound bytes are identical either way).

## Portability

The sensors are the platform's half, and they are deliberately the least exotic syscalls available:
`getrusage` and `mincore` exist on every POSIX target, need no permission, and cannot be disabled by
a vendor kernel the way PSI and `mlock` are here. On a platform that cannot report residency (the
Windows host build) the sample reads as unmeasured, the loop stays calm, and the budget behaves
exactly as a static one — which is the right degradation.

An iOS port would replace only the sensor: `os_proc_available_memory()` plus
`DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_MEMORYPRESSURE`, which unlike `onTrimMemory` fires on both edges. The
governor and the actuator do not change.

## Status

Off by default, and the app exposes it as a switch ("Pressure-aware cache sizing"). It stays off
until the on-device A/B says otherwise — the same discipline that turned the rewarm pass off after
it was measured. The tunables (0.90 residency, ×3 faults, ×0.7 cut, 64 MiB growth) are compiled in
rather than exposed: they are control-loop policy, not per-device facts, and the loop discovers the
device's concession at runtime regardless.
