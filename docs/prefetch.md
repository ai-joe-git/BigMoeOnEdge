# Temporal prefetch

The expert LRU cache is filled reactively: a layer's experts are read only once its router has
selected them. That leaves the read on the critical path — the first tokens of a generation miss
often and stall on flash (see [benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md)). Temporal prefetch reads ahead.

## The bet

MoE routing has strong temporal locality: the experts a token selects at layer *l* overlap
heavily with the experts the **previous** token selected at the same layer. So while a token
computes layer *l*, we speculatively read — on the otherwise-idle I/O lanes — the experts the
previous token routed at layers *l+1 … l+K* (`--prefetch K`). A correct guess turns the next
layer's read into a cache hit; a wrong guess only wastes a read. For the very first generated
token, the predictor is the last prompt token's routing, recorded during prefill.

`K` is a depth, not a certainty: recall falls as you look further ahead, so small `K` (1–2)
captures most of the benefit. Prefetch requires the LRU cache (`--cache-mb > 0`); the speculative
slices land in the per-layer cache buffers.

## How it stays correct and out of the way

The speculative path never delays real work and never changes output:

- **Same bytes.** A speculative read is the *identical* read a real miss would issue — same file
  offset, same destination buffer (`lbuf_[p][il] + e*slice`). A prefetched expert is therefore
  bit-for-bit what a real read would produce; a later routing that hits it gets identical bytes.
  Integration cannot change output by construction. Gates **G5a/b/c** assert this.
- **One writer of cache state.** All LRU mutation stays on the eval-callback thread.
  `prefetch()` (eval thread) commits pages and enqueues per-projection reads; **workers only read
  bytes**; `quiesce_spec()` (eval thread, at the next real `load_layer`) integrates the entries
  whose every projection finished and releases the rest. No lock on the hot path.
- **Real work wins.** Workers drain the real batch first and only spend spare capacity on the
  speculative queue, yielding the instant a real batch appears. At each real load, in-flight
  speculation is cancelled (its reads disowned) before staging touches the cache, so speculation
  can never race the reads a token actually depends on, nor hold a page an eviction wants.

Because speculation only pays off when there is real flash latency to hide, it does nothing on a
fast host with the model in page cache (the reads are cancelled before they start) — which is
exactly correct. It is measured on-device.

## Telemetry

With `--prefetch K` the summary gains a `moe-prefetch:` line: speculative MiB read this
generation, and how many prefetched experts a later routing actually used (`useful / prefetched`).
A low useful rate means the look-ahead is too deep for this model, or the cache is too small to
hold the speculation alongside the working set.

`--prefetch-sync` (debug) completes speculative reads synchronously on the eval thread — it
defeats the latency hiding but makes integration deterministic, which the gates use to exercise
the integrate-then-hit path on a host where the timing race otherwise never fires.
