# Android memory reclaim, from the engine's point of view

Why a >RAM streaming engine loses its working set on an Android phone, which levers exist (almost
none), and which numbers to check before believing any theory about it. Measured on a OnePlus 15R
(Android 16, kernel 6.12, 11.4 GB RAM, 12 GB swap, **not rooted**) while running gpt-oss-120b; the
mechanisms are generic, the constants are this device's.

Everything below is either read from `/proc` on the device or read from vendor GPL source. Where a
value could not be read live, it says so — several of the load-bearing ones are root-only.

## The shape of the problem

Reclaim is **not an event to recover from, it is a standing condition**. It happens *while the engine
decodes*, not only while it idles. Through one in-app turn, sampled every 4 s:

```
t=4    RssAnon 2.02 GB   swap 463 MB     <- full cache resident
t=12   RssAnon 1.86 GB   swap 620 MB     <- the kernel is taking it
t=20   RssAnon 1.57 GB   swap 917 MB
t=44   RssAnon 1.46 GB   swap 1.02 GB
t=68   RssAnon 2.02 GB   swap 468 MB     <- the engine faults it back
t=88   RssAnon 1.88 GB   swap 596 MB     <- and loses it again
```

That oscillation, not any single reclaim, is what costs the turn.

## Free memory, and why 95 MB is not a crisis

Watermarks act on **MemFree** — physically empty page frames — not on `MemAvailable`. Linux keeps
MemFree near zero deliberately: unused RAM is wasted RAM, so everything spare becomes page cache. A
healthy phone therefore lives *at* its watermarks, and kswapd waking is normal, not pathological.

Zone Normal on this device (`/proc/zoneinfo`), against 11.4 GB of RAM:

| watermark | pages | bytes | effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| min | 5,792 | **22.6 MiB** | below: **direct reclaim** — the allocating thread reclaims, synchronously |
| low | 24,262 | **94.8 MiB** | below: kswapd wakes |
| high | 42,732 | **166.9 MiB** | kswapd reclaims up to here, then stops |

Both gaps are 18,470 pages; since `gap = max(min/4, managed × wsf / 10000)` with managed = 2,841,569,
the implied **`watermark_scale_factor` ≈ 65 against a stock default of 10** — kswapd here is 6.5×
more hysteretic than stock, chasing 167 MiB free.

The signal that something is actually wrong is **not** "kswapd is running". It is `allocstall_*` and
`pgsteal_direct` in `/proc/vmstat`: direct reclaim is billed to *your* thread as uninterruptible
sleep, inside `llama_decode`, where no tok/s counter can see it. System-wide here: `pgsteal_kswapd`
270,019,486 vs `pgsteal_direct` 80,282,940 — **23% of all steals are direct**.

## Two kinds of memory, and why ours is the expensive kind

| | reclaim cost | restore cost |
|---|---|---|
| **clean file-backed** (mmap'd weights, page cache) | **free** — dropped, no I/O | re-read from the file |
| **anonymous** (our expert cache buffers) | compress + write to zram, maybe writeback to NAND | read + decompress |

The expert cache is *a copy of bytes that already exist in the gguf*, held in the one form the kernel
must write out to reclaim. `pswpout` on this device: **36.8 M pages ≈ 140 GB written since boot**.
Worse, Q4_K_M weights are high-entropy, so zram stores them near-uncompressed: the swapout burns CPU
both ways and frees almost nothing. *(Inference — `/sys/block/zram0/mm_stat` is root-only; check
`huge_pages` vs `pages_stored` with root to settle it.)*

This is the unnoticed cost of the O_DIRECT design. O_DIRECT buys large sequential reads instead of a
4 KiB demand-fault storm — real and worth having — but it also converts free evictions into paid
ones. Any future design should weigh both halves.

## The hit rate is what decides whether the kernel keeps your cache

The LRU promotes a page from *inactive* to *active* only on a **second reference** — and a cache hit
*is* a second reference. So the cache hit rate is not merely "flash reads avoided": it is literally
the signal the kernel uses to decide whether your memory deserves to stay.

| model | file | cache | hit | tok/s | what the kernel concludes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3-30B-A3B | 18.5 GB | 4000 MiB | **77.1%** | 4.57 | touched twice → active → protected |
| Gemma-4-26B-A4B | 17.0 GB | 4000 MiB | **82.9%** | 4.76 | same |
| gpt-oss-120b | 58.5 GB | 3000 MiB | **13.4%** | 1.15 | touched once → inactive → swapped |

And the hit rate is geometry, not tuning:

```
gpt-oss-120b: 56.8 GB experts / (36 layers × 128) = 12.3 MB per expert slot
              3000 MiB cache covers  5.2% of the bank  ->  13% hit
Qwen3-30B:    16.3 GB experts / (48 layers × 128) =  2.6 MB per expert slot
              4000 MiB cache covers 24.5% of the bank  ->  77% hit
```

gpt-oss's bank is 3.5× larger with 4.6× fatter slices, so the same cache covers 5× less of it. Cover
5% of a 128-expert bank with near-uniform routing and you hit ~13%. **On that model the kernel is
right: it is being asked to hold 2 GB of pages the engine itself touches once.** A cache below some
coverage ratio does not merely fail to pay — it actively harms, by evicting the dense weights it
competes with and by driving the allocation churn that wakes kswapd.

## The vendor tilts the field against anonymous memory

`/dev/memcg/.../memory.swappiness` reads **100**, and that number is a decoy. The module
`oplus_bsp_zram_opt` is **verified loaded** (`/proc/modules`) and hooks `android_vh_set_swappiness`,
overriding the sysctl *inside* the reclaim path ([zram_opt.c](
https://github.com/OnePlusOSS/android_kernel_msm-5.4_oneplus_sm6375), GPL, © Oplus):

```c
static int g_direct_swappiness = 60;
static int g_swappiness = 160;

static void zo_set_swappiness(void *data, int *swappiness) {
    if (current_is_kswapd()) *swappiness = g_swappiness;      /* 160 */
    else                     *swappiness = g_direct_swappiness; /* 60 */
}
static void zo_set_inactive_ratio(void *data, unsigned long *inactive_ratio, bool file) {
    if (file) *inactive_ratio = min(2UL, *inactive_ratio);
    else      *inactive_ratio = 1;
}
```

Swappiness is a 0–200 ratio of the assumed relative I/O cost of swap vs filesystem paging (see
[vm.rst](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/sysctl/vm.html)); 100 is parity. So **kswapd scans anon
with 4× the pressure of file cache**, which is why 2 GB of our cache goes to zram while 4.9 GB of
page cache stays. `inactive_ratio = 1` for anon additionally forces it ~50% deactivated — parked, by
construction, on the list reclaim eats first. Corroborated live: Active(anon) 459 MB vs
Inactive(anon) 3,123 MB (87% inactive).

> ⚠️ **Load-bearing and unverified.** The `160` comes from OPLUS's 5.4 source; the module is verified
> loaded on this 6.12 device, but `/sys/module/oplus_bsp_zram_opt/parameters/vm_swappiness` is
> root-only and **was not read**. High-confidence inference, not a measurement. With root, one
> command settles it.

Note the asymmetry: kswapd (160) prefers stealing our anon, while our own direct-reclaim stalls (60)
steal file cache — we evict our own dense weights when we allocate too fast.

## Nothing protects anonymous memory. Every lever, and why it is closed

| lever | verdict here |
|---|---|
| `mlock` / `mlockall` / `MAP_LOCKED` | **dead** — `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` = **65536 bytes, soft and hard** (`/proc/<pid>/limits`; AOSP `init.rc` sets it). 64 KB of a 2 GB cache = 0.003% |
| `setrlimit` to raise it | **dead** — raising the *hard* limit needs `CAP_SYS_RESOURCE`; an app has neither that nor `CAP_IPC_LOCK` |
| cgroup `memory.min` / `memory.low` | **absent** — memcg here is **v1** at `/dev/memcg` (0700 root:system, `limit_in_bytes` unlimited); those knobs are v2-only, and cgroup2 has no memory controller |
| `memory.reclaim` | v2-only, and unused by AOSP anyway |
| `/proc/<pid>/reclaim` | **does not exist** — a Qualcomm patch, never mainline; AOSP moved to `process_madvise()` in Android 12 |
| MGLRU knobs | `CONFIG_LRU_GEN=y` and default-enabled, but `/sys/kernel/mm/lru_gen/enabled` = `0x0000` — **vendor-disabled at runtime**. Classic active/inactive LRU applies |
| `MADV_HUGEPAGE` | no-op — THP is `[never]` |
| `oom_score_adj`, foreground service | affect **kill** selection only. Kernel reclaim is LRU-based and process-agnostic; it never consults them |
| `onTrimMemory` | notification only, and largely deprecated — apps are not notified of most levels since API 34 |
| Memory Advice API | **deprecated**; only warns, never keeps anything resident |
| `MAP_POPULATE` | prefaults, does **not** pin. Load speed only |
| **`MADV_COLD` / `MADV_PAGEOUT`** (5.4+) | **the one real lever** — unprivileged. Can't stop reclaim, but *chooses its victims*: volunteer your own cold tail so kswapd finds cheap targets and you cut direct-reclaim stalls |
| **dma-buf via `AHardwareBuffer`** | **open, and the only allocation here that reclaim cannot touch** — those pages stay pinned because a device may DMA from them at any time, and no capability is needed. Reads at full anonymous-memory speed (measured 1.00×, [2026-07-21](bench-data/2026-07-21-pinned-memory/findings.md)). Capped at **2047 MiB per buffer**: `AHardwareBuffer_lock` fails with `EINVAL` at 2^31 bytes even though allocation reaches the 4 GiB format cap. **Untested against real pressure** — see below |

**lmkd never reclaims — it only kills — and here it is silent by design.** It early-returns while
`SwapFree >= swap_free_low_percentage` (10%) of total; we sit at 70–79%. **The 12 GB swap is exactly
why nothing protects us**: from lmkd's view, a machine with free swap is a healthy machine. The
vendor's Osense/"nirvana" chases `purposeFreeMB=390` but kills `type=cached` apps only and cannot
touch a top-app process; its `kill cnt=0` log lines are the sound of the system running out of *other*
victims before kswapd comes for us.

For contrast: iOS exposes `os_proc_available_memory()` (a real per-process budget) and an entitlement
to raise it. **Android has no equivalent of either.** No on-device runtime surveyed (llama.cpp, MLC,
MediaPipe/LiteRT, ONNX Runtime, ExecuTorch) pins weights on Android or publishes a "stay under X% of
RAM" rule; llama.cpp's `--mlock` fails here for the reason above, and ExecuTorch explicitly maps
Android to `NoMlock`.

## The dma-buf exception, and what it does not solve

Everything above is about memory the kernel is *allowed* to take. There is one allocation it is not:
a **dma-buf**, whose pages are pinned for the lifetime of the buffer because a device may DMA from
them at any moment. An app reaches one through `AHardwareBuffer` with format `BLOB` — no capability,
no root, and it sidesteps `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` entirely, since it is not `mlock` at all.

Measured properties on the test device ([data](bench-data/2026-07-21-pinned-memory/findings.md)):

| property | value |
|---|---|
| read bandwidth vs anonymous memory | **1.00×** — 30.4 GiB/s and 45.2 GiB/s on the two clusters, 59.0 at 4 threads, all matching anon within 0.5% |
| `CPU_READ_OFTEN` vs `CPU_READ_RARELY` | no difference; the hint does not have to be coaxed |
| max usable size | **2047 MiB per buffer** — `AHardwareBuffer_lock` returns `EINVAL` at 2^31 bytes, a signed-32-bit boundary, though allocation reaches the 4 GiB format cap |
| allocation cost | ~7–11 GiB/s, i.e. a few hundred ms once, at load |

That the bandwidth is ordinary is the load-bearing result, because it was the plausible way for the
idea to be dead on arrival: gralloc chooses per allocation whether a buffer is CPU-cacheable, and an
uncached mapping would read at or below flash bandwidth — making pinned weights slower than
refaulting them.

**None of that is an argument that pinning the dense weights helps.** Reclaim-exempt memory does not
create memory: under a >RAM model, RAM the dense weights no longer yield has to come from the expert
cache or from the page cache feeding the streaming path. That is the same trade that refuted the
bulk restore (below) and the per-layer LFU cap. And these measurements never put the device under
the pressure a >RAM decode creates, so "the kernel cannot reclaim it" remains an inference from how
dma-buf works rather than something observed here. The lever is **open, and unproven**.

## Why restoring reclaimed pages cannot win

`MADV_WILLNEED` on anon does swap them back in — but `read_swap_cache_async` puts them on the
**inactive** list (`folio_add_lru`, `mm/swap_state.c`); nothing marks them accessed. Only a real
second touch promotes to active. So a bulk restore hands the kernel a pile of pages at the *front of
the eviction queue*, and at swappiness 160 with `inactive_ratio = 1` the next pass comes almost
immediately.

Measured: restoring 1.76 GB took 6.4 s and the kernel had it back in 8 s, with the turn still at
0.3 tok/s. **That 8 s is a property of the LRU, not of the code.**

The corollary is the useful part: a restore is only worth anything if the pages get *hit* right
after — which makes its value a function of the hit rate, and predicts it helps exactly the
high-hit-rate models it was not designed for.

## Checklist before believing any theory here

- Read `MemFree` **and** `MemAvailable` **and** `Cached` — free ≈ 100 MB is normal, not a symptom.
- Split RSS: `/proc/<pid>/status` → `RssAnon` vs `RssFile` vs `VmSwap`. `VmSwap` sees only the
  anonymous half; **file-backed reclaim is invisible to it**, and it was 27× larger here
  (`workingset_refault_file` 114.8 M vs `workingset_refault_anon` 4.2 M).
- `VmHWM` tells you whether a process ever held what you think it held — it catches "this is a fresh
  process", which looks identical to "this process was stripped" in a bare RSS sample.
- Rates, not counters: `/proc/vmstat` totals are since boot. Delta them over a window.
- **Measure in the app.** The app's engine drops 3.5 GiB → 3.5 MiB within ~5 s of a reply; an adb
  session took 4 minutes to lose half that, and a second adb run barely lost anything. Every bench
  script in this repo is single-shot and never idles, so none of them can see this class of bug.
  Seeing it takes two turns with a timed idle gap between them, sampling `/proc` through the gap.
- Beware `pgrep -f <name>`: the shell running the command matches its own command line. A 3.8 MB
  "engine" is your own `sh`.
